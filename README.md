Hello! Stuffed Animal Purgatory is a 2D Platformer Game about a stuffed animal being thrown away, becoming lost in an unknown land. 
Our protagonist meets a trio of other abandoned toys, tries to learn how to traverse this new land, and find out what caused them to be lost. 

Unfortunately, not everything went super well with this project. This is actually the second version of it, as the first one got destroyed. 

Some Issues that still exist:
- The music is non-existent in-game, along with the sound effects.
- The dialogue is also non-existent. It was completely lost.
- The animations are poor.
- Game Slowness.
- The ending is not really there with the lack of the dialogue.

BUT, from this project I've had the opportunity to do a lot, like:
- Learn so much about Unity.
- Improve my Aseprite skills.
- Gain a greater dislike for FL Studio.
- Panic (a bit, sorry!)

This game will (hopefully) be up on itch.io when it is completed. Apologies for the delay and issues!
